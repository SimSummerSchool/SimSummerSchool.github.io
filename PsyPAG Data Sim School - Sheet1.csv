Oli Clark,Monday 7th June,13:00,1.5 hours,Synchronous,Y,Intro to simulation-based power analysis,"This will be a really basic introduction to random number generation, loops, and functions which will put you in good stead for the remainder of the workshops. We will look at simulating independent samples and running t-tests on them thousands of times to get an idea of the distribution of p-values when there is a known effect, and when there is not.",N/A,N/A,,,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/intro-to-simulation-based-power-analysis-tickets-153666710267,https://youtu.be/UG4ObG1OBaE

Sarah Chadwick,Friday 11th June,13:00,2 hours,Synchronous,,Simulating response accuracy data at the item-level using a logistic multilevel model,"In this session we will simulate participants' item-level response data, where the observed response is binary (0 = incorrect, 1 = correct). We will look at this in the context of a multilevel design, where the dataset includes multiple observations of the same participants and the same items. To do this, we will use a logistic multilevel model to describe the response generating process. Building from a simple model of the response generating process, we will look at including single and multiple predictors which change the log odds of observing a correct response (i.e. effects). Random intercept and effect variances, and the covariance between these, will also be explored. We will also look at how we could estimate the statistical power to detect an effect of interest according to our defined model, for a given experimental design. The freely available programs R and R Studio will be used to code and run the simulations. All code will be available for the simulations in this session.",Basic understanding of R and regression,"lme4, MASS, ggplot2",,,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/simulating-item-level-response-accuracy-w-sarah-chadwick-tickets-153669175641, https://youtu.be/Wvd6gEkVfJk
Vimal Rao,Monday 14th June,16:00,1.5 hours,Synchronous,Y,Simulation-based inference with R for ANOVA design experiments,"A common design for psychological experiments is a comparison of measures between groups of participants based on their experimental condition. This design is analogous to the ANOVA statistical model. Using the mathematically-defined F-distribution is an opaque way of operationalizing ANOVA designs. Instead, this workshop focus on simulation-based approaches and will teach attendees how to utilize R and simulation to compare experimental data to the expectations based on candidate hypotheses. Topics covered will include (1) Specifying a detailed design model, (2) Identifying random sources of variation, (3) identifying and quantifying potential experimental sources of variation, (4) simulating results under candidate models, (5) drawing conclusions.","Basic understanding of random allocation, as well as fixed effects models (e.g., one-way and two-way ANOVA) and repeated measures (e.g., pre and post testing).

Mark Lai,Wednesday 16th June,17:00,1.5 hours,Asynchronous,N/A,Advancing Quantitative Science with Monte Carlo Simulation,"In this workshop, we will introduce the basic statistical foundation of the Monte Carlo method and discuss how it is used to evaluate properties of estimators (e.g., unbiasedness, efficiency, robustness). An illustrative example will be used to compare the efficiency of the median relative to the mean. I will also discuss the concept of Monte Carlo simulation error, and touch on simulating multivariate normal data for structural equation modeling","Basic statistical concepts such as Type I error, statistical power, and the sampling distribution",tidyverse,,,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/advancing-quantitative-science-with-monte-carlo-simulation-w-mark-lai-tickets-153708683811, https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8yE0xYJxnw2CPgORbAAmnvGZLHtVu1Pb
James Bartlett,Friday 18th June,13:00,2 hours,Synchronous,Y,Using simulation in pre-registration,"In this workshop, I will cover a more general approach to demonstrate how you can take advantage of simulation to make a more effective pre-registration. I will use an R Markdown template that makes it easy to include a simulated power analysis (covered by other workshops) and planned analysis steps using simulated data. The first hour will be dedicated to a walk through of creating a preregistration using simulated data. The second hour will be dedicated to working on your own preregistration with the opportunity to troubleshoot.",Basic understanding of simulation from previous sessions; understand the purpose and structure of a preregistration protocol,tidyverse; prereg,N/A,,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/using-simulation-in-pre-registration-w-james-bartlett-tickets-153709313695, https://youtu.be/VdhtdsKtac0
Dan Wright,Monday 21st June,17:00,,Synchronous,,Using simulation before implementing policies in education,"I will discuss two sets of simulations that evaluated algorithms that were in use to give grades to schools. For both, participants will construct the code for the simulations (with guidance from the instructor) and run the simulations. We will discuss whether governments should use simulation of algorithms prior to their implementation if they are not sure how they will perform.",Experience with lme4 useful but not required.,lme4,,,https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/using-simulation-before-implementing-policies-in-education-w-dan-wright-tickets-153709696841, https://youtu.be/4QCZZNOQTHY

Oscar L. Olvera Astivia,Friday 25th June,17:00,2 hours,Synchronous,Y,"Simulation of multivariate, non-normal data","This workshop introduces the NOrmal To Anything (NORTA) method as a general technique to simulate a variety of non-normal distributions where the researcher controls the correlation structure of the data (i.e., the population correlation matrix) as well as the non-normality of the univariate, marginal distributions (both continuous and discrete). It begins with a quick overview of the multivariate normal distribution and how it can be altered to allow the user to either control the skewness and excess kurtosis (for continuous data) or the number of categories and frequency (for discrete data). It aims to connect the NORTA approach to popular techniques such as the 3rd order polynomial transformation and other algorithms which are commonly used in simulation studies in the psychology, education and the social sciences.","Intermediate understanding of R (e.g., can download packages, update them, do manipulations of data.frame and matrix objects, can run multiple regression analyses); multivariate statistics.","All R code and packages will be provided.

Mark Andrews,Monday 28th June,13:00,,Synchronous,N/A,Posterior/prior predictive checks in Bayesian modelling,"Posterior predictive checks are used to evaluate model fits and model assiumptions in Bayesian (MCMC) based analyses. They involve drawing samples from the posterior distribution to general hypothetical data sets, and then comparing these data sets with the observed data to indentify discrepancies between the model's predictions and the reality of the data. Posterior predictive checks are particularly useful in complex models where the assumptions of the model are not very easy to check. By contrast to posterior predictive checks, prior predictive checks are very useful to  clarify the assumptions of choices of priors. Again, hypothetical data sets are generated and these make it clear what kinds of the data the prior distribution does and does not assume. ","Experience with general data analysis in R.
